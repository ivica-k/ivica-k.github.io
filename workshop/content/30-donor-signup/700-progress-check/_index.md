# Progress check

Now would be the perfect time to do a progress check because real fun starts very soon and I would like all of us to be on the same page.

Before going any further you should have:

- [x] AWS credentials set up (verify with `aws sts get-caller-identity`). [Setup page](../20-prerequisites/100-setup.html)
- [x] Login to AWS Console. Follow the link given to you for details and credentials
- [x] "Hello World" AWS Lambda function deployed and working
- [x] "Donor sign-up" AWS Lambda function with local tests
- [x] "Donor sign-up" AWS Lambda function with logging, deployed and returning the JSON payload it receives

If any of these is not working for you - **please let me know**. If everything mentioned above worked for you, great!

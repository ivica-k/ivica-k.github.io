# Improvements

This chapter deals with several important topics. They are not crucial for the working
of the application but they add much needed improvements to make the application
more maintainable and standardized.

These topics are:

- Refactoring the database layer to make it more readable and maintainable
- Using a `DBResponse` class for standardized communication
- Improving the tests
- Introducing the concept of AWS Lambda layers

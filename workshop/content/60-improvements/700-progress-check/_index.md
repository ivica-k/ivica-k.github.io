# Progress check

Now would be a good time to do a progress check because we did a lot of work.

Before going any further you should have:

- [x] Separated code for the database layer; donations and donors in their own files
- [x] A standardized response from the API layer with status codes that indicate if an error occurred
- [x] A standardized response from the database layer in the `DBResponse` class
- [x] Fixed and improved tests for the "Donor sign-up"
- [x] Tests for the "Donation event" creation
- [x] Thin Lambda function, with dependencies split into a Lambda layer

If any of these is not working for you - **please let me know**. If everything mentioned above worked for you, great!

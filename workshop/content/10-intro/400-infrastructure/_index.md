# Infrastructure

The general idea of this workshop is to show the basics of serverless app development with Python. Managing AWS
infrastructure efficiently and with the correct tools is a secondary goal. That is why we will be using AWS CLI or
very simple Python scripts to provision infrastructure. Real-world projects would rely on some form of 
infrastructure-as-code (IaC), using tools like:

- AWS CloudFormation
- AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
- Terraform
- Pulumi
- Ansible

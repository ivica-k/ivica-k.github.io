# What are we going to build?
We are going to build a blood donation app! People, such as you and me, can use it to register as donors and 
organizations such as blood banks or Red Cross can use it to schedule blood donation drives. We will also do a bit of
role-play, imagining that Red Cross is our client and we are a one person software/cloud consultancy agency.

#### Client requirements
- Web based
- Incurs little to no cost when unused
- Does not require a big team of people to maintain it - ideally volunteers can do it

#### Features
- A person can sign-up to become a donor
- An organization can create blood donation events
- Donors receive an email when a new event is created in their city


## What we are not going to build

This workshop will not focus on creating any frontend components, dashboards or similar.

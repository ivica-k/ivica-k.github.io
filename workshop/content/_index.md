# Welcome Python people!

## What this workshop IS

- It is a beginners guide to building serverless applications with Python
- It is an introductory guide to a couple of serverless services from AWS

## What this workshop IS NOT

- It is not a comprehensive guide to serverless technologies, AWS, Python or any combination of those
- It is not a be-all-end-all, one-workshop-to-rule-them-all. Some parts may be wrong, outdated, unoptimized and opinionated
- It is not associated, endorsed, sponsored or in any way related to AWS

## Basic rules

- Learn something new
- Have fun
- Teach something new; even if you think you are a beginner I am sure that you can teach us something we don't know and you do
- Bring your questions; hopefully someone in the room can answer them. If not, there's Google
- Keep the discussion central so we all can pitch in

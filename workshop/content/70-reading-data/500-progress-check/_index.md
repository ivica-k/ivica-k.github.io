# Progress check

Now would be a good time to do a progress check because we did so much work.

Before going any further you should have:

- [x] "Get all donors" AWS Lambda function deployed that returns all donors that signed up
- [x] "Get a single donor" AWS Lambda function deployed that returns details for a single donor
- [x] "Get all donation" AWS Lambda function deployed that returns all donations that were created
- [x] "Get a single donation" AWS Lambda function deployed that returns details for a single donation

If any of these is not working for you - **please let me know**. If everything mentioned above worked for you, great!

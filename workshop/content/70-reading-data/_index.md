# Reading data

All the work we did so far focused heavily on writing data to a table. This is not how a real world, functioning
application would look like. We need some data-reading features to be displayed on a web page.

The workshop itself will not focus on the web component. We will focus on delivering the data from a table through the 
API we're building.

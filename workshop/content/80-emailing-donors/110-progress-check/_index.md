# Progress check

Before wrapping up, in this chapter we:

- [x] Learned what secondary indexes are and how to use them to enable a different query pattern 
(get all donors from a specific city)
- [x] Deleted our DynamoDB table one last time... :)
- [x] Learned about and enabled DynamoDB streams so that our application can react to DynamoDB inserts
- [x] Learned about and configured stream data filtering which enabled us to react only to new blood donation events
- [x] Used AWS SES to send emails to donors from a specific city whenever a new blood donation event is created

# Progress check

Now would be the perfect time to do a progress check because we did a lot of work.

Before going any further you should have:

- [x] A DynamoDB table named `YOUR_FIRST_NAME-savealife-dev` created
- [x] "Donor sign-up" AWS Lambda function deployed and persisting the data to the above-mentioned table

If any of these is not working for you - **please let me know**. If everything mentioned above worked for you, great!
